# 🏡 House Price Prediction (Regression)
### 📌 Overview
This project applies machine learning regression techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property attributes. The goal is to demonstrate how regression models can be used in real estate analytics to estimate property values and assist buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions.
